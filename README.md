# Password-Generator-

## Description

Most businesses have a login and password that they may require the customer to make when they register. Security is an important feature to have and being able to work on a challenge that gives me the opportunity to work on this, is great experience. One day, I plan to work on my brother's law firms website and I would want to make sure that the password feature works well. A generator application like this can help provide customers with strong passwords so that it will make a extremely difficult for hackers to try and figure out. It creates an extra level of security. I learned how using arrays, a for loop, if statements, event listener and functions can help make this password generator function properly. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

If you click on the red generate button, it will give you an option of how long you would like your password to be. It will also ask you if you would like to add special, uppercase, lowercase and or numeric characters that will generate a password.
